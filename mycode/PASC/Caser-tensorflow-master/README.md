(http://www.sfu.ca/~jiaxit/resources/wsdm18caser.pdf)

This repo is implementation of Caser. Codes are based on [graytowne/caser-pytorch](https://github.com/graytowne/caser_pytorch) and I just converted them to tensorflow.

## Requirements
I developed it under the environments as below.
- Python 2.7x
- Tensorflow v1.11.0
- Numpy
- Scipy

## Usage
1. Install required packages
2. run <code>python train_caser.py</code>
